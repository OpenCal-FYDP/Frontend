This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Setup on local for development
Make sure you have node installed.
`node install` in the root directory of this project.

### Authenticating with OAuth
You need to create a `.env.local` file in your root of this project.

Inside if you want to use my development Github OAuth `OpenCAL-dev-wrwalker`
You should insert the following:
```
GOOGLE_ID=707155551889-5fq7p2oe1jn9bacdlkarnolmipbmelk9.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_SECRET=GOCSPX...
GITHUB_ID=bf46f2d5367b3ef7e1de
GITHUB_SECRET=56f1...
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
Secret can be provided upon request.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
